            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                It all began with a simple question: <em>"What are we really putting on our skin and hair?"</em> 
                Years ago, our founder struggled with persistent skin and scalp issues, and no conventional product seemed to help. After extensive research, it became clear that many products on the market were filled with harmful chemicals that did more harm than good.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspired by the healing power of nature, we embarked on a journey to create skincare and haircare products that are not only effective but also safe and gentle for everyone. That’s how our organic skincare and haircare brand was born.
